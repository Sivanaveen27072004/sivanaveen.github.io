        <h3><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Internship</h3>
        <p>During my internship at ASM Technologies, I worked as a Software Engineer and was deployed as a vendor to Foxconn, a leading electronics manufacturing company. My role involved working on the software systems used for automation machines. I was responsible for identifying and fixing code-level errors in the existing software, which was originally developed in Chinese. Collaborating with my team, we successfully developed an English version of the same software to enhance accessibility and usability for non-Chinese users.
Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in C#, VB.NET, and GUI development, deepening my understanding of industrial automation systems and real-time error handling in production environments. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and exposed me to cross-functional teamwork in a global manufacturing context.

        <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Projects</h3>
        <h4>Academic Project: Weather Forecasting Based on CubeSat</h4>
        <p>My project is about building a small satellite model (CubeSat) to collect weather data like temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and pressure. It sends this data wirelessly to a ground station using LoRa technology. The data is then used to predict the weather using Python code. The system also sends weather updates to people through SMS using a GSM module. It's mainly designed for hilly and remote areas where thereâ€™s no internet.</p>
